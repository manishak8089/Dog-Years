# Dog Years

This is a simple C++ program to convert a dog's age into human years. The conversion logic is as follows:

- The first two years of a dog's life count as 21 human years.
- Each following year counts as 4 human years.

This training project is prepared by Codecademy.

## Getting Started

### Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the age of your dog. After entering the age, it will display the equivalent human age based on the conversion rules mentioned above.

```sh
Enter the dog's age: 3
Human age is: 25
